## About


Upload videos to Cloudflare Stream within Umbraco CMS, and display these videos on your site. This integration allows you to display videos without needing to host the files directly on your server. Your videos will be streamed via Cloudflareâ€™s global Content Delivery Network (CDN), helping to improve load times and playback performance for your users, no matter where they are.

Cloudflare Stream also supports adaptive bitrate streaming, which automatically adjusts video quality based on the viewerâ€™s connection, ensuring smooth playback even on slower networks. By offloading storage and bandwidth demands, this approach reduces strain on your server and improves overall site efficiency. 

Encoding, delivery, and player integration are all handled for you, removing the need to manage complex infrastructure or third-party tools.

The package also adds a default [Media Type](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cms/fundamentals/data/creating-media/default-media-types) and [Media Picker](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cms/fundamentals/backoffice/property-editors/built-in-umbraco-property-editors/media-picker-3) to provide an out of the box experience for content editors.


## Quick Start
> [!Note]
> You will first need an active Cloudflare Stream subscription and [API token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/)

### Install the package via NuGet

```bash
dotnet add package ReadingRoom.Umbraco.CloudflareStream
```

### Configure `appsettings.json`

Add the following section to your `appsettings.json` file:

```json
{
  "CloudflareStream": {
    "AccountId": "eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee",
    "ApiToken": "F-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "CustomerSubdomain": "customer-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx.cloudflarestream.com"
  }
}
```

### Upload a video

1. Go to the Media section in the Umbraco backoffice
2. Click on the `Create` button
3. Select the `Cloudflare Stream Video` Media Type
4. Upload a video file
5. Save and publish the Media ðŸš€

You can now select the video from the Media Picker in the Content section.

### Select a video

Videos uploaded to Cloudflare Stream will be displayed in the Media Picker alongside other media items.

> [!TIP]
> You can use the `CloudflareStreamVideoPicker` Data Type to restrict the Media Picker to only show
Cloudflare Stream videos. 
>
> This also tells Models Builder to return `CloudflareStreamMediaValue` instead of `MediaWithCrops`

## Display a video

### Accessing Video URL

In your view, you can display the video by calling `Url()` on the property and outputting it in an `iframe`:

```csharp
<iframe src="@Model.Video.Url()"
        style="border: none;"
        allow="accelerometer; gyroscope; autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; fullscreen;"
        allowfullscreen="true">
</iframe>
```

If you want the underlying `CloudflareStreamMediaValue` object you can call the `GetCloudflareStreamMediaValue()`
extension method:

```csharp
var data = Model.Video.GetCloudflareStreamMediaValue();
if (data != null)
{
    <div>
        @data.Size
        @data.VideoId
        @data.Playback.Url
        @data.Playback.ThumbnailUrl
        @data.Playback.DashManifestUrl
        @data.Playback.HlsManifestUrl
        @data.Playback.IFrameUrl
    </div>
}
```

### Tag Helper

You can use the `cf-stream` tag helper to render the video in your view

- Add tag helper to your `_ViewImports.cshtml` file

```csharp
@addTagHelper *, ReadingRoom.Umbraco.CloudflareStream
```

- Use the `cf-stream` tag helper in your view

```html

<cf-stream video="@Model.Video"/>
```

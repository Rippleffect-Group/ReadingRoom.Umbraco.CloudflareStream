# ReadingRoom.Umbraco.CloudflareStream

Upload videos directly to Cloudflare Stream (CFS) within Umbraco CMS, and display these videos on your site. CFS allows you to display videos on your site, without needing to host the files directly on your server, often improving video load speed.

The package adds a Media Type and Media Picker to provide a seamless experience for content editors - no technical expertise needed to use the integration once installed and configured.

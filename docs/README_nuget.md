**ReadingRoom.Umbraco.CloudflareStream** integrates [Cloudflare Stream](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/developer-platform/products/cloudflare-stream/) seemlessly into the [Umbraco](https://umbraco.com/) content editing experience. 


No technical expertise is required by content editors to use the integration.
## About


Upload videos to Cloudflare Stream within Umbraco CMS, and display these videos on your site. This integration allows you to display videos without needing to host the files directly on your server. Your videos will be streamed via Cloudflareâ€™s global Content Delivery Network (CDN), helping to improve load times and playback performance for your users, no matter where they are.

Cloudflare Stream also supports adaptive bitrate streaming, which automatically adjusts video quality based on the viewerâ€™s connection, ensuring smooth playback even on slower networks. By offloading storage and bandwidth demands, this approach reduces strain on your server and improves overall site efficiency. 

Encoding, delivery, and player integration are all handled for you, removing the need to manage complex infrastructure or third-party tools.

The package also adds a default [Media Type](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cms/fundamentals/data/creating-media/default-media-types) and [Media Picker](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cms/fundamentals/backoffice/property-editors/built-in-umbraco-property-editors/media-picker-3) to provide an out of the box experience for content editors.
